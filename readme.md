# Club Website - Dog Walk EasterBay

My dream is to become a developer. To reach this goal I created a account on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).\
This project is a part of my journey towards my new career and I'm learning so much about coding.

To make this Club Website I had to challenge myself and really practice on coding flexbox and\
understand how to code a responsiv page.

## Project Description
This project was about creating a responsive website with, among other things, media queries.\
In other words, the website should look good regardless of which device you use to view the website.

I live in a small town in Sweden called Påskallavik, translated in to English \
"Påsk" is "Easter" and "Vik" is "Bay" so I decided to call my club for dog walking **"Dog Walk EasterBay"**.

This club is fictionary and does not exists. But if it did, the website would have made it possible \
for members to keep track of the **_schedule of the walks_** and the opportunity to sign up for **_newsletters_** \
as well as look at pictures in the **_gallery_**.
